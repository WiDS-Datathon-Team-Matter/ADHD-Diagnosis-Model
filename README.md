## **🏗️ Project Overview**

**The Kaggle Competition and Break Through Tech AI**
The Kaggle Competition was called "WiDS Datathon 2025: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD," where we worked to predict ADHD diagnoses in patients and their sex. This was done through Cornell's Break Through Tech AI program where we study Python and machine learning in a collaborative and supportive environment for women. Our Kaggle Competition aligned well with our program, as ADHD is harder to diagnose in females, and when left undiagnosed, ADHD can be a struggle to deal with daily.

**Challenge Objective**
We hope that by designing and implementing a machine learning model that can accurately predict a person's sex and their ADHD diagnosis, patients can be correctly diagnosed and learn how to deal with their ADHD. 

**Real-World Significance and Impact**
Many young people suffer from ADHD, especially women, and without a proper diagnosis, they must continue living their lives unaware of ways or methods to help them get through the day. By properly diagnosing women, they can come to terms with their mental health and learn of better ways to reach their goals without having to unknowingly suffer greatly through ADHD symptoms.

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
